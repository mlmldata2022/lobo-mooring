The data come from the L01 buoy just up channel from the Highway 1 bridge. This buoy is maintained by Dr. Ken Johnson's Chemical Sensors group at MBARI, which develops new technology in order to understand high-frequency fluctuations in biogeochemical parameters over long time periods.\n",

The water depth plot primarily shows the tides, which have a fortnightly spring-neap cycle. The nitrate data also show high-frequency variability due to the tides, but there are also irregular pulses of high nitate. This is the winter season, and freshwater runoff from storms can have very high nitrate concentrations because of of all the agriculture in the watershed."
